        <h3>Arc Flash Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            In 2005, the introduction of NFPA 70E led to the requirement that all Healthcare, Industrial 
            and Commercial buildings must provide Arc Flash warning labels at each piece of new and existing 
            electrical distribution equipment. This requirement is intended to protect individuals who may 
            come in contact with energized equipment.. For the past three years, we here at Pezzoni Engineering 
            have been spreading the word about the dangers Arc Flashes can pose to employees and their employers, 
            and have been helping clients bring their facilities into compliance. Our Arc Flash Analysis services include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arc Flash Analysis</li>
            <li>Equipment Labeling in Accordance with NFPA 70E</li>
            <li>Arc Flash Information and Safety Training Seminar</li>
            <li>Coordination Studies to improve power system reliability</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
